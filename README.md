# üß† Basal Ganglia Action Selection with FUS Modulation

This demo shows **how the basal ganglia (BG)** select between competing actions ‚Äî and how **focused ultrasound (FUS)** can modulate that process by temporarily reducing cortical drive to the striatum (as in ALIC-targeted OCD treatments).

Built in **[Nengo](https://www.nengo.ai)**, it‚Äôs both a neuroscience teaching tool and a sandbox for developing neuromodulation models.

## üîç Overview

- The **cortex** sends two action drives to the basal ganglia.  
- The **basal ganglia** inhibit all actions by default, then *disinhibit* the strongest one.  
- The **thalamus** relays the selected action back to cortex for execution.  
- **FUS** acts as a *temporary attenuator* on one corticostriatal pathway, reducing its influence.

When the FUS is active, the affected action‚Äôs signal weakens ‚Äî often flipping which action ‚Äúwins.‚Äù

## üß© How It Works

| Component | Function | Analogue in Brain |
|------------|-----------|------------------|
| `cortex` | Competing input signals (two actions) | Frontal cortex |
| `BasalGanglia` | Selects one action by disinhibiting it | Striatum + GPi |
| `Thalamus` | Relays winning action to motor areas | Thalamus |
| `FUS` node | Temporarily scales down one cortical drive | ALIC pathway under ultrasound |
| `kappa_in` | Slider to control FUS strength (0‚Äì1) | Effective inhibition |

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run It

```bash
pip install nengo nengo-gui scipy
nengo_gui bg_action_fus.py
```

Then:
- **Spacebar** ‚Üí start/stop simulation  
- **Right-click** nodes ‚Üí add *Sliders* and *Plots*  
- Add sliders for:
  - `kappa_in` (FUS strength)
- Plot:
  - `Cortex`, `GainVec`, `BG output`, `Thalamus`

Watch the Thalamus outputs ‚Äî the higher one is the ‚Äúchosen‚Äù action.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Parameters

| Variable | Meaning | Typical |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| `fus_blocks` | When FUS is active (s) | `[(1.6, 3.0)]` |
| `kappa_default` | FUS effect strength | `0.5` |
| `dimensions` | Number of actions | `2` |

## üß™ What to Observe

| Phase | Expected behaviour |
|-------|--------------------|
| **Pre-FUS** | Action 1 dominates (higher cortical drive). |
| **During FUS** | Action 1 is attenuated ‚Üí the *green* channel in the Basal Ganglia plot drops, showing renewed inhibition. |
| **Post-FUS** | Normal competition resumes and Thalamus output stabilises again. |

*Screenshot showing the moment FUS activates: the FUS node rises (bottom), Action 1‚Äôs cortical drive is reduced (middle left), and the Basal Ganglia‚Äôs disinhibition of that channel collapses (middle right), restoring inhibition to Thalamus.*

## üß† For Experts

- The model uses Nengo‚Äôs **rate-based BasalGanglia** and **Thalamus** networks.  
- FUS modulation is implemented as a **time-varying multiplicative gain** on the `cortex ‚Üí BG` connection.  
- Extendable to:
  - More actions (dimensions > 2)  
  - Noisy or oscillatory modulation (for PRF-locked studies)  
  - Task-switch paradigms or stop-signal models

## üå± For Newcomers

Think of this as a **neural traffic light**:
- The **BG** holds all actions at red.  
- The **strongest** one gets a green light.  
- **FUS** temporarily dims one signal ‚Äî so another may pass first.

## üß© Next Steps

- Add a **FUS node** with realistic pulse trains (PRF ‚âà 500 Hz).  
- Couple to an **EEG readout** model for closed-loop testing.  
- Embed as a **decision-core** inside avatar or cognitive simulations.
